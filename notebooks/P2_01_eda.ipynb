    "# 1. Problem decription\n",
    "\n",
    "[chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess), one of the most known games in the world is regularaly played by multiple people accross the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are couple of known chess variants:\n",
    "- **Blitz Chess and Bullet Chess**: These are faster versions of traditional chess. Blitz games typically allow 3 to 5 minutes for each player for all their moves, while bullet games might have even shorter times, such as 1 or 2 minutes.\n",
    "- **Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess)**: Invented by former World Chess Champion Bobby Fischer, Chess960 starts with a random positioning of the non-pawn pieces on the first rank, with the placement of pieces mirrored on both sides. This variation has 960 possible starting positions, significantly reducing the reliance on opening preparation.\n",
    "- **Xiangqi (Chinese Chess)**: While derived from the same Indian game as international chess, Xiangqi includes different pieces, a board with the \"river\" in the middle, and specific areas called \"fortresses\" for the generals (kings). It is massively popular in China and has different strategic principles.\n",
    "- **Shogi (Japanese Chess)**: Shogi features a drop rule, allowing captured pieces to be returned to the board under the captor's control. This variant is characterized by its almost limitless possibilities for gameplay, as pieces can re-enter play rather than being permanently removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hopefully this work will try to uncover patterns on those games(depending on time constains)**"
